## Installation instructions

The only requirement for running our main function is [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Run benchmark

To see the options for running our benchmark, run `python3 thread.py --help`. There are four arguments that control the number of threads (customers), tellers (shared resources), test iterations (number of times to run benchmark) and the timeout duration for each thread.

To run the benchmark, simply run `python3 thread.py`
